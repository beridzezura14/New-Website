      <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
      <p>At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.</p>
      <p>This module contains the following articles, which will take you through all the basic theory of HTML and provide ample opportunity for you to test out some skills.</p>
      <h2>started with CSS</h2>
      <p>Covers the absolute basics of HTML, to get you started — we define elements, attributes, and other important terms, and show where they fit in the language. We also show how a typical HTML page is structured and how an HTML element is structured, and explain other important basic language features. Along the way, we'll play with some HTML to get you interested!</p> 
      <h2>CSS fundamentals</h2>
      <p>One of HTML's main jobs is to give text meaning (also known as semantics), so that the browser knows how to display it correctly. This article looks at how to use HTML to break up a block of text into a structure of headings and paragraphs, add emphasis/importance to words, create lists, and more.</p>

      <h2>Creating hyperlinks</h2>
      <p>Hyperlinks are really important — they are what makes the web a web. This article shows the syntax required to make a link and discusses best practices for links.</p>
